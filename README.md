# ThingPicker

This is a toy project to help someone show what type of an object they
like or wish for. It uses Firebase as a backend database and the Flickr
API to retrieve photos of the desired object.

For example, one might configure the project to look for photos of
'high heels'. ThingPicker would then fetch and show pictures of high
heel shoes (or whatever the Flickr API retrieves) and the end-user can
select whether they love, like, or hate any given pair of shoes.
